== Description ==

This is a little plugin which adds a featured image column to WordPress. It automatically adds a column to any post type which supports a featured image. The code is pulled almost directly from my plugin [Display Featured Image for Genesis](http://wordpress.org/plugins/display-featured-image-genesis/).
